# Notes-app 

A small ```Nodejs``` application that allows the user take notes using the commmand line interface.

The only required external node module needed is ```yargs```, you can clone and run ```npm install``` to install this package. I recommend also having Nodemon and chalk installed.

Available commands to use the ```notes-app``` are: ```add``` & ```delete```

Note: all lower case.
