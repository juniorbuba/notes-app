# Notes-app 
![image of note and pen](note.jpg)

A small ```Nodejs``` application that allows the user take notes using the Commmand Line Interface.

The only required external node module needed is ```yargs``` and ```chalk```, you can clone and run ```npm install``` to install these packages. I recommend also having Nodemon installed.

Available commands to use the ```notes-app``` are: ```add``` & ```delete```(for now)

Note: all lower case.
